        support UI Framework **(CST UI Framework)** with best practices and 
        best options available in open sources community. Since each project from 
        DBS should have consistency. So we build the UI Components and created its 
        documentation and **plunker** for live example. We configured all pain point 
        on a fresh project creation one face. We build **cstui-cli** which will 
        generate **scaffolding** app which includes 
        1. PCF/AWS deployment 
        2. SonarQ test configuration 
        3. Unit & e2e test configuration 
        4. cst-components library included 
        5. Few example with login screen (Option to select basic or rich login on cli). 
         (Login was integrated with LDAP authentication).
